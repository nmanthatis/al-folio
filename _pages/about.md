Hi and thanks for stopping by!

I'm a Mechanical Engineering graduate from [Aristotle University of Thessaloniki](https://auth.gr/en). My field of specialization is `Control Theory` and `System Dynamics`.

I worked at the UAV-iRC center that develops and manufactures novel UAVs. I was a member of the control team, under the supervision of [Prof. P. Seferlis](https://users.auth.gr/seferlis) where our goal was to create the control algorithm for the autonomous flight of a VTOL UAV. 

I am looking forward to enrich my knowledge in control systems and apply it in biomedical problems.
